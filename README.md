# Suppy
## Material flow simulator written in Python and JS

### Features
- Multiple node types (called atomics in the code), some are meant to reflect real-world cases like buffer, transform, repair etc, while others are mainly utils for designing the flow - i.e. confluence, divergence.
- Drag and drop + infinite canvas style (zoom in/zoom out pending?)
- Load existing projects / save project (undo/redo is probably the next improvement on the map)
- Generates a simple web page with the simulation results upon clicking Run in the menu

### Setup
- Pip install from requirements.txt
- Drag and drop (and might cause a crash) won't work on linux due to so some event handlers only being implemented windwos-style
- For tests `root/suppy/suppy> pytest`

### Note on the tests
- most of them are integration-like tests -> atomics are created and connected through resource streams and attached to an event handler
- input: event handler, configuration of atomics (including starting materials)
- output: stats for individual atomics

Detailed stats generated by the simulation (note: semi finite mean objects in the chosen terminology describe parts which couldn't reach an end node because some other parts needed for further processing are missing)
